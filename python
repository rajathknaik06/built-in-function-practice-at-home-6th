""" 
Sarah is a technical writer who is responsible for formatting two important documents. Both documents contain a certain placeholder character that needs to be replaced with another character before they can be finalized. To ensure consistency in formatting, Sarah wants you to help her write a program that processes both documents by replacing the placeholder character with the new one.



Sarah also prefers a neat and structured output, so she wants you to ensure that both modified documents are printed in a single line, separated by a space, using the format() function.



Example



Input:

Hello

World

o

a

Output:

Hella Warld

Explanation:

Here the character 'o' is replaced with 'a' in the concatenated string.

Input format :
The first line contains string1, the first document.

The second line contains string2, the second document.

The third line contains char1, the placeholder character that needs to be replaced.

The fourth line contains char2, the new character that will replace the placeholder.

Output format :
The output displays a single line containing the modified string1 and string2, separated by a space."""


string1 = input()
string2 = input()
char_to_replace = input()
char_to_replace_with = input()

str1 = ""
for char in string1:
    if char == char_to_replace:
        str1 += char_to_replace_with
    else:
        str1 += char

str2 = ""
for char in string2:
    if char == char_to_replace:
        str2 += char_to_replace_with
    else:
        str2 += char

result = "{} {}".format(str1, str2)
print(result)
